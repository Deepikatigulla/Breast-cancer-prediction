# Macro Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates a machine learning workflow for data analysis and predictive modeling using Python. The workflow includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the implementation of various machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). Additionally, it incorporates techniques like cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.

## Features

- Comprehensive data preprocessing and visualization
- Implementation of multiple classification models
- Evaluation using metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrix
- Model optimization via cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd macro-project
   ```

## Dependencies

The project requires the following Python libraries:

- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis
- `numpy`: For numerical operations
- `matplotlib`: For data visualization
- `seaborn`: For advanced data visualization
- `scikit-learn`: For machine learning algorithms and utilities

## Usage

1. Launch the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook macro_project.ipynb
   ```
2. Open the notebook and follow the steps outlined to:
   - Load and preprocess the data
   - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
   - Train and evaluate machine learning models
   - Visualize results and insights
